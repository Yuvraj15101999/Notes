OpenStack remains the worldâ€™s leading open-source cloud platform and its
adoption continues to grow every year . According to the latest results from
an annual OpenStack User Survey, published in November 2022, OpenStack
now powers more than 40 million cores in production across over 300 surveyed
deployments

This phenomenon has its roots in the superior economic advantages that
OpenStack brings to organisations of all sizes and across industries. Being an
open-source project, OpenStack allows for significant cost savings compared to
proprietary virtualisation solutions, such as those in VMware, Citrix and Proxmox
families. At the same time, it is a fully functional cloud platform which serves as
an extension or a reasonable alternative to hyperscalers, effectively addressing
cloud cost optimisation and digital sovereignty concerns

At the same time, OpenStack adoption has always been a challenge. This
is certainly the case for those with no previous experience with Linux and
cloud computing. 

Issues in Open Stack Cloud Implementation
- Thousands of design options
- Dedicated hardware required
- Complicated installation instructions
- Time-consuming operations


Simplifying OpenStack adoption

Sensible defaults
The leading choices for hypervisor, SDN solution and storage platform
are Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) / Quick EMUlator (QEMU), Open vSwitch
(OVS) / Open VIrtual Network (OVN) and Ceph respectively

Minimal footprint
ight mechanism for each of its services and carefully
optimising their parameters it is possible to minimise the footprint of OpenStack

Lucid interface
Users can answer some essential
questions during the initial deployment and request certain post-deployment
actions, while benefiting from total bottom-up automation taking place in the
background.

K8s-native framework
What all those legacy Kubernetes-based OpenStack platforms have been missing
are Kubernetes operators  Those software extensions encapsulate the
knowledge, wisdom and expertise of real-world operations teams, and codify it
into computer programs that help to operate complex application ecosystems.
